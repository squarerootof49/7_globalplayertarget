# Seven's Global Player Target (ironically, GPT)
## A super simple, highly configurable, WIP, global player target ("third-eye") menu using ox_target, ox_lib and ox_inventory.
Made this resource as my **first ever** coding experience with Lua and FiveM, and is _**obviously not done yet**_.
### Big thanks to multiple users of the [Overextended Discord Server ](https://discord.gg/overextended) for helping me understand many basic coding concepts and practices and optimize the code the I wrote.
