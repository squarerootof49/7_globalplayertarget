# Seven's Global Player Target (ironically, GPT)
## A super simple, highly configurable, WIP, global player target ("third-eye") menu using ox_target, ox_lib and ox_inventory.
Made this resource as my **first ever** coding experience with Lua and FiveM, and is _**obviously not done yet**_.
### Big thanks to [Overextended](https://github.com/overextended) for, _well_, making the resources I used and multiple users of the [Overextended Discord Server ](https://discord.gg/overextended) for helping me understand many basic coding concepts and practices, as well as optimizing the code that I wrote.
